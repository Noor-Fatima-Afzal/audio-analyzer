 Hello everyone. In this English episode, we will be focusing on English conversation. Listening to English conversation is an essential part of improving your English language skills. It can help you improve your listening, speaking, and comprehension skills. In this video, if I ask you a question, Do you like village or city life? You can comment what you like, and now we will be talking about this. Let's start. Hi, how are you doing today? I'm doing well, thank you. How about you? I'm good too. So, I was thinking about the differences between village life and city life. What do you think about it? Oh that an interesting topic I personally prefer village life because it more peaceful and closer to nature what about you well I have lived in both village and city and I think both have their pros and cons take a pause here did notice the words here pros and cons what does it mean it's mean advantages and disadvantages now let's continue the conversation for example in the village people are more friendly and helpful but the facilities are not as advanced as in the city yeah I agree with you in the city there are more opportunities for education employment and entertainment but it's also more crowded and polluted absolutely I think it depends on the individuals priorities and lifestyle for example if someone wants to have a quiet and simple life the village is a better option but if someone wants to have a fast and dynamic life the city is a better option That a good point Also in the village people have closer relationships with their neighbors, and they tend to support each other in times of need. But in the city, people are more independent, and they rely on themselves more. Yes, that's true. But on the other hand, in the city, there is more diversity and exposure to different cultures, which can broaden one's perspective. I agree with you. So, overall, I think both village and city life have their own merits and demerits. It's up to the person to decide what suits them best. Exactly. It's all about personal preferences and priorities. But it's always good to have a balance between the two, if possible. Yes that a good idea It always good to experience both ways of life and appreciate the differences Hey Anna, how are you doing? I'm good, thanks for asking. How about you? I'm doing well too. Hey, I was thinking of getting a pet for my house. What do you think? Honestly, I'm not a big fan of keeping pets inside the house. Really? Why not? Well, I think pets can be a lot of work and responsibility. Plus, they can also cause allergies or other health issues for some people. I understand your concerns. But I think having a pet can be really rewarding too. They can be great companions and help reduce stress. I can see that, but I also worry about the mess and potential damage they can cause.
